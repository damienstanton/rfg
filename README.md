There is so much material to cover that couldn't possibly fit in a single, informal talk, so these links
should provide curious programmers with everything they need to pick up and become efficient Rustaceans.

- The playground is a great place to develop conceptual understanding. It makes available the top 100 crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io), and so is useful for testing ideas even outstide `std`.
